Thank you for downloading this datapack!
If you liked or have any ideas for other advancements that could be added to this datapack (or found any issues) feel free to comment or join the
BlazeandCave discord at https://discord.gg/GBMSmWg to speak with us.

Please use Minecraft 1.20.4 for this version.
The datapack probably will not continue to work properly in future versions. Please make a backup of your world before attempting to use in future versions in case of bugs.

IMPORTANT: This datapack requires BlazeandCave's Advancement Pack v1.16 to run.
This can be downloaded here: https://www.mediafire.com/file/xeauvwmf7excv19/BlazeandCave%2527s_Advancements_Pack_1.16.7.zip/file

--- Installing ---
1) Unzip the compressed folder that you downloaded. Find the main datapack file named "BACAP3"

2) 
- For a new world: You can click the "Data Packs" option when creating a new world. Copy the BlazeandCave's Advancement Pack and BACAP3 folder into the file popup.
  Mouse over both datapacks and add them to the world. IMPORTANT: BACAP3 must be HIGHER PRIORITY (visually higher up) than BlazeandCave's Advancement Pack.
  If you don't do this, you can run function blazeandcave:bacap3/install to reorder the datapacks. (Or manually run /datapack disable "BACAP3" and /datapack enable "BACAP3" last)
  
- For an existing world: Copy the folder labelled "BACAP3". Paste it into the following folder directory in the world you want to install them in: <World name>/datapacks.
  Then, load the world and run /function blazeandcave:bacap3/install

3) Go into the world. A message should pop up saying you are using BlazeandCave's advancements pack. If not, check your advancements menu. You should see the custom tab named "BlazeandCave's Advancements"

If you forgot to load the datapacks when creating from a new world, type the command: /datapack enable "file/bac_advancements"


--- Configuration ---
The advancements pack can be easily configured using the config menu, which can be displayed by running the following command:
/function blazeandcave:config

Using the config menu you can:
- Disable and enable item rewards, trophies, and the welcome message by simply clicking their checkboxes.
- Disable and enable different types of advancement completion messages.
- Display the advancements scoreboard on the tab list and/or sidebar. You can also clear it from there.
- Update the advancements scoreboard for all players online.
- And much more
